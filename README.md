WOMEN'S CLOTHING E-COMMERCE
Topic and Background
This dataset is about Women's Clothing E-Commerce, the dataset shows the details about the reviews written by customers and the ratings on how customer graded the products and service. We use 2 algorithms in this project: Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis. Since there is a rating range in this dataset, we would like to analyze to understand what is the portion of each rating point, what made customer decide to rate that level and what is the most topics that customers mentioned, as well as to understand customer's opinions and emotions through the text reviews.

For Sentiment Analysis, we will learn about the contexts of text and identify and extract subjective information in source material, and help the business to undertand the social sentiment of their brand, product and service while monitoring online conversations.

We use Topic Modeling to discover the abstract "topic" that occur in customer's review, then we can organize and get some insights to understand the topics that were mentioned in this dataset and what is the trend that customers gave out in this data.

Below are some of the questions we have before start learning this dataset:

What is the age/rating distribution?
What is the number of purchase by department/class?
What is the most discussed topics in customer's reviews?
What is the context of the review: positive, neutral or negative?
Is it a negative or positive trend of customer reviews of this whole text data?
etc...
Then from the answers of those questions, business can monitor brand and product as well as service based on customer feedbacks and understand customer needs and what to improve on their products/service.
